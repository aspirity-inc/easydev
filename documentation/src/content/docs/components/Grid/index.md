Grid system uses a rows and columns for layout and align content. Itâ€™s built with flexbox for high flexibility.

## How it works?

- Create a series of columns that align with the row in a horizontal layout (shortened as col).
- Place your content elements directly inside the col and only the col should be placed directly inside the row.
- The range of the column grid system is represented by a value of 1-24.
- Padding is added to items in order to create space between them.
