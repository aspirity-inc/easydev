# Easydev

EasyDev is a library of React UI components based on styled-components made by the Aspirity team. Leveraging best practices gleaned from diverse projects, we've architected this library for code elegance and user-friendly integration. Although it is still in its pre-alpha stage, this version has a kit of core components that can effectively cover your development requirements.
